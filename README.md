# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

There is now the final implementation of our spreadsheet project. There is a GUI that functions as a spreadsheet, allowing us to modify cells
in a spreadsheet and calculate values. We can know also save, open, or create a new spreadsheet with widgets at the top of the display.
There have been some changes to the Spreadsheet program. The expression evaluator is now able to catch errors in input before runtime,
there are more delegates that allow the user to specify the type of variable inputted, and there are helper methods that allow comparison
between expressions. A big change we have made allows the user to convert a group of cells to an XML file as well as convert an XML file 
full of cells back into code. We have now added a spreadsheet functionality, including the creation of cells that can be manipulated like 
adding cells or returning the contents. The spreadsheet also prevents incorrect inputs and circular dependencies. The spreadsheet also has 
the ability to conduct a series of operations on an ordered pair that represents the dependents and dependees of a dependency graph.
