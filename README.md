# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

There have been some changes to the Spreadsheet program. The expression evaluator is now able to catch errors in input before runtime,
there are more delegates that allow the user to specify the type of variable inputted, and there are helper methods that allow comparison
between expressions. A big change we have made allows the user to convert a group of cells to an XML file as well as convert an XML file 
full of cells back into code. We have now added a spreadsheet functionality, including the creation of cells that can be manipulated like 
adding cells or returning the contents. The spreadsheet also prevents incorrect inputs and circular dependencies. The spreadsheet also has 
the ability to conduct a series of operations on an ordered pair that represents the dependents and dependees of a dependency graph. Future 
extensions are creating the GUI interface for our spreadsheet project.
