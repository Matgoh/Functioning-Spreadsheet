# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

There have been some changes to the Spreadsheet program. The expression evaluator is now able to catch errors in input before runtime,
there are more delegates that allow the user to specify the type of variable inputted, and there are helper methods that allow comparison
between expressions.We have now added a spreadsheet functionality, including the creation of cells that can be manipulated like adding cells
or returning the contents. The spreadsheet also prevents incorrect inputs and circular dependencies. The spreadsheet also has the ability to 
conduct a series of operations on an ordered pair that represents the dependents and dependees of a dependency graph. Future extensions are 
allowing for the calculations of negative numbers for expressions.Eventually, this assignment will allow for the complete manipulation of data 
on a spreadsheet.
