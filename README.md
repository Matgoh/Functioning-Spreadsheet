# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

There have been some changes to the Spreadsheet program. The expression evaluator is now able to catch errors in input before runtime,
there are more delegates that allow the user to specify the type of variable inputted, and there are helper methods that allow comparison
between expressions.The spreadsheet also has the ability to conduct a series of operations on an ordered pair that represents the dependents 
and dependees of a dependency graph. Future extensions are allowing for the calculations of negative numbers for expressions and the fixing of 
loops on dependent and dependee variables.Eventually, this assignment will allow for the manipulation of data on a spreadsheet.
