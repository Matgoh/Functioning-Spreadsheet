# Comments to Evaluators:
	Our work stands on its own.

# Partnership:

//TODO: briefly describes the contributions of each member.  If all code was completed via pair programming, state as much.  
		If each partner completed (some small) different sections of work, also indicated this.
		
- A good bit of our code was done via pair programming, but we also worked on different sections of work at the same time. Matthew completed everything lol.

//TODO: Detail any branches that were made so that each partner could work on separate functionality.  Describe the merge process and any challenges involved in it.  Make sure to list the commit numbers. 

- We did not branch off to complete this project, though we understand the usefulness of branching and plan to use it in the next coming projects.

//TODO: In clear prose, describe to the TAs the list of design choices you made as well as your added features.  
		This should include how to utilize the features.
		
- Some design choices that we decided to make our project unique was... 
		
//TODO: If you worked in a partnership, write two paragraphs.  The first should list one or two examples where 
		the partnership was most effective.  What did you do right and how did it make the coding process faster, 
		and the code better? Include details on how assigning tasks helped. 
		The second paragraph should be about an area of teamwork that you need to improve upon.
		
	One example where the partnership was most effective for this assignment was being able to work remotely and make progress on the GUI twice as fast through two machines. Another was being able to bounce ideas off each other and come to a consensus of how we wanted to design our GUI so there was no confusion in coding simultaneously. Assigning tasks was especially effective because we understood who was working on what during the coding session, so we would not need to inquire the other about what we were attempting to do. 
	An area of teamwork that I need to improve on is not procrastinating getting started on a project just because there is partnerwork as an option now. To be effective as a team, both members (especially Alex) need to efficiently plan out their times to work and contribute 50/50. Another aspect that could be improved is updating our task bar, so there is no confusion between teammates. Being able to efficiently update the project tasks develops chemistry on a team and shortens the whole process. 
	
# Assignment Specific Topics:

Matthew:
	- Time Spent Effectively:
	- Time Spent Debugging:
	- Time Spent Learning:

//TODO: Add a paragraph or two to the README reflecting on how your estimates are getting better/worse/etc. 
and what they are telling you about your abilities.

Alex:
	- Time Spent Effectively: 5
	- Time Spent Debugging: 4
	- Time Spent Learning: 2

I believe my estimates are getting much better as we continue each project because it becomes easier for me to see how long it would take to finish certain functions and syntax on the assignment since I have been doing it for half a semester now. What this is telling me is that I am better understanding my own abilities in coding, whether it comes to implementing, testing, and debugging the program.
