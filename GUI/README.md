# Comments to Evaluators:
	Our work stands on its own.

# Partnership:

//TODO: briefly describes the contributions of each member.  If all code was completed via pair programming, state as much.  
		If each partner completed (some small) different sections of work, also indicated this	

//TODO: Detail any branches that were made so that each partner could work on separate functionality.  
		Describe the merge process and any challenges involved in it.  Make sure to list the commit numbers. 

//TODO: In clear prose, describe to the TAs the list of design choices you made as well as your added features.  
		This should include how to utilize the features.
		
//TODO: If you worked in a partnership, write two paragraphs.  The first should list one or two examples where 
		the partnership was most effective.  What did you do right and how did it make the coding process faster, 
		and the code better? Include details on how assigning tasks helped. 
		The second paragraph should be about an area of teamwork that you need to improve upon.
